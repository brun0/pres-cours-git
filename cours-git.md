	* One may create development branches

- Being able to come back to previous versions
- Saving sources on distant repositories
- knowing where you are and avoid having 20 times the same file: modelV1.pcl, modelV2.pcl, modelV3.pcl..
- Share models and changes
- Find a specific change performed long time ago
- ...
